     There lived-was the old man. At it was three sons: two clever, the third - little fool Emelja.
      Those brothers work, and Емеля all the day lays on an oven, the nobility wants nothing.
      Once brothers have left on a market, and women, daughters-in-law, allow to send it:
      - Descend, Емеля, behind water. And it it from an oven:
      - Reluctance...
      - Descend, Емеля, and that brothers from a market are turned back, gifts to you will not bring.
      - Well it is fine. Tears Емеля from an oven, has put shoes on, has put on, took buckets yes an axe and has 
      gone on small river.
      Has cut through ice, has scooped a bucket and has put them, and itself looks in an ice-hole. Also has seen 
      Емеля in an ice-hole a pike. Has contrived and has seized a pike in a hand:
      - Here an ear it will be sweet!
      Suddenly the pike speaks to it a human voice:
      - Емеля, release me in water, I will be useful to you. And Емеля laughs:
      - On what you will be useful to me? No, I will incur you home, I order to weld to daughters-in-law to an 
      ear. An ear it will be sweet. The pike has begged again:
      - Емеля, Емеля, release me in water, I to you will make everything, that will wish.
      - All right, only show at first, that you do not deceive me then I will release.
      The pike asks it:
      - Емеля, Емеля, tell - that you now want?
      - I want, that buckets have gone home and water would not be spilt...
      The pike speaks to it:
      - Remember my words: when that to you will want - tell only:
      On pike веленью, On mine хотенью.
      Емеля also speaks:
      - On pike веленью, On mine хотенью - go, buckets, home...
      Only has told - buckets and have gone uphill. Емеля has started up a pike in an ice-hole, and itself has 
      followed buckets. There are buckets on village, the people marvel, and Емеля go behind, laugh...
      Buckets have come into a log hut and steels on a bench, and Емеля has got on the furnace.
      Whether has passed it is a lot of, whether there is not enough time - daughters-in-law speak to it:
      - Емеля, what you lay? Would go fire wood has cut.
      - Reluctance...
      - You will not cut fire wood, brothers from a market are turned back, gifts to you will not bring.
      Емеле the reluctance to climb down from the furnace. He has recollected about a pike and on the sly speaks:
      - On pike веленью, On mine хотенью - поди, an axe, pin fire wood, and fire wood - in a log hut go and in 
      the furnace be put...
      The axe has jumped out from under a bench - and on a court yard, and allow fire wood to prick, and fire 
      wood goes to a log hut and in the furnace climbs. Whether it is a lot of, whether not enough time has 
      passed daughters-in-law again speak:
      - Емеля, fire wood at us is not present more. Go to wood, cut.
      And it it from an oven:
      - Yes you on what?
      - How we on what?. Unless our business in wood behind fire wood to go?
      - To me a reluctance...
      - Well, there will be no to you gifts.
      There is nothing. Tears Емеля from the furnace, has put shoes on, has put on. Took a cord and an axe, left 
      on a court yard and villages in sledge:
      - Women, open gate!
      Daughters-in-law speak to it:
      - What you, the simpleton, villages in sledge, and have not harnessed a horse?
      - It is not necessary to me to a horse.
      Daughters-in-law gate have opened, and Емеля speaks on the sly:
      - On pike веленью, On mine хотенью - go, sledge, in wood...
      Sledge also have gone to gate, yes so quickly - on a horse not to catch up.
      And it was necessary to go to wood through a city, and here it to many people has rumpled, has suppressed. 
      The people shout: "Hold it! Catch it!" And it know sledge sends on errands. Has arrived to wood:
      - On pike веленью, On mine хотенью - an axe, cut дровишек more chilly, and you, дровишки, fall in sledge, 
      match...
      The axe has started to cut, prick dry a tree, and дровишки in sledge fall also a cord match. Then Емеля 
      ordered to cut down to an axe to itself a bludgeon - such that насилу to lift. Villages on a cart:
      - On pike веленью, On mine хотенью - поезжайте, sledge, home...
      Sledge have rushed off home. Again passes Емеля on that city where recently has rumpled, has suppressed to 
      many people, and there it wait. Have seized Емелю and drag with a cart, abuse and beat.
      He sees, that has badly put, and on the sly:
      - On pike веленью, On mine хотенью - well, a bludgeon, break off it sides.
      The bludgeon has jumped out - allow to bang. The people have rushed away, and Емеля have arrived home and 
      have climbed on the furnace. Whether long, whether shortly - the tsar about Емелиных tricks has heard and 
      sends behind it the officer: it to find and bring to a palace.
      There comes the officer to that village, enters into that log hut where Емеля lives, and asks:
      - You are a fool Emelja?
      And it from an oven:
      - And you on what?
      - Put on more likely, I will carry you to the tsar.
      - And me a reluctance...
      The officer has become angry and has struck it on a cheek.
      And Емеля speaks on the sly:
      - On pike веленью, On mine хотенью - a bludgeon, break off to it sides...
      The bludgeon has jumped out - and allow to bang the officer, насилу it has carried away feet.
      The tsar was surprised, that its officer could not cope Емелей, and sends most набольшего the grandee:
      - Bring to me to a palace of fool Emelju, and that a head from shoulders I will remove.
      The grandee to raisin, prunes, spice-cakes has bought набольший, has arrived to that village, has entered 
      into that log hut and began to ask daughters-in-law that loves Емеля.
      - We Емеля loves, when it will tenderly ask yes a red caftan will promise, - then it will make all, that 
      will ask.
      Набольший the grandee has given Емеле to raisin, prunes, spice-cakes and speaks:
      - Емеля, Емеля, what you lay on the furnace? We will go to the tsar.
      - To me and here warmly...
      - Емеля, Емеля, at the tsar you will well feed-give to drink, - please, we will go.
      - And me a reluctance...
      - Емеля, Емеля, the tsar to you the red caftan will present, a cap and boots.
      Емеля has thought-has thought:
      - Well it is fine, go you forward, and I for you following will be.
      There has left the grandee, and Емеля has lain down also speaks:
      - On pike веленью, On mine хотенью - well, the furnace, поезжай to the tsar...
      Here in a log hut corners have cracked, the roof has reeled, the wall has taken off, and the furnace itself 
      has gone along the street, on road, is direct to the tsar.
      The tsar looks in a window, marvels:
      - It that for a miracle?
      Набольший the grandee answers it:
      - And it Емеля on the furnace to you goes.
      There was a tsar on a porch:
      - Something, Емеля, on you is a lot of complaints! You to many people have suppressed.
      - And what for they under sledge climbed?
      At this time in a window on it the imperial daughter - the Marja-tsarevna looked. Емеля увидал it in a 
      window also speaks on the sly:
      - On pike веленью, On mine хотенью - start up the imperial daughter me will grow fond...
      Also has told still:
      - Go, the furnace, home...
      The furnace has turned and has gone home, has come into a log hut and became on a former place. Емеля again lays-polezhivaet.
      And at the tsar in a palace shout yes tears. The Marja-tsarevna on Емеле misses, cannot live without it, asks the father that it has given out it for Емелю in marriage. Here the tsar began to speak, затужил also speaks again набольшему to the grandee.
      - Go result in me Емелю live or dead, and that a head - from shoulders I will remove.
      The grandee of wines sweet yes has bought набольший different snack, has gone to that village, has entered into that log hut and beginnings Емелю to treat.
      Емеля has got drunk, has gorged on, was drunk and has laid down to sleep. And the grandee has put it in a vehicle and has carried to the tsar. The tsar immediately ordered прикатить big to a flank with iron hoops. In it have planted Емелю and Марьюцаревну, have pitched also to a flank in the sea have thrown. Whether long, whether shortly - has woken up Емеля; sees - darkly, closely.
      - Where it I?
      And to it answer:
      - Boringly and тошно, Emelja! Us in a flank have pitched, have thrown in the dark blue sea.
      - And you who?
      - I am a Marja-tsarevna.
      Емеля speaks:
      - On wave of the wand, On mine хотенью - winds violent, roll out to a flank on dry coast, on yellow sand...
      Winds violent have blown. The sea was excited, to a flank has thrown out on dry coast, on yellow sand. Емеля and the Marja-tsarevna left it.
      - Емелюшка where we will live? Construct what on is an izba.
      - And me a reluctance... Here she began to ask more still it, he and speaks:
      - On pike веленью, On mine хотенью - build a stone palace with a gold roof... Only he has told - there was a stone palace with a gold roof. Around - a green garden: flowers blossom also birds sing.
      Marja-tsarevna with Емелей have entered into a palace, have sat down at a window.
      - Емелюшка, and it is impossible for you красавчиком to become?
      Here Емеля not for long thought:
      - On pike веленью, On mine хотенью - to become me kind молодцем, a hand-written handsome man... Also became Емеля such, that in a fairy tale to tell, a feather to describe.
      And the tsar went to that time on hunting and sees - there is a palace where before was nothing.
      - That for the boor without my permission on my earth the palace has constructed it?
      Also has sent to learn-ask: "Who such?"
      Ambassadors have run, steels under a window, ask. Емеля to them answers:
      - Ask the tsar to me on a visit, I to it will tell. The tsar has arrived to it on a visit. Емеля him meets, conducts in a palace, puts for a table. They start to feast. The tsar eats, drinks and not надивится:
      - Who you such, kind good fellow?
      - And you remember little fool Emelju - as came to you on the furnace, and you ordered it with the daughter in a flank to pitch, in the sea to throw? I - that Емеля. I will want - all your kingdom пожгу and I will ruin.
      The tsar strongly was frightened, began прощенья to ask:
      - Marry my daughter, Емелюшка, take my kingdom, only do not ruin me!
      Here have arranged a sumptuous feast. Емеля married the Mare-tsarevna and began to correct a kingdom.
      Here and a fairy tale the end and who listened - the good fellow.
