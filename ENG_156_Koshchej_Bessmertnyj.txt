 ONCE there was a king who had an only son. When the prince was small, 
 his nurses and governesses sang lullabies to him. "Prince Ivan, when 
 you grow up, you will find your bride," they would sing. "Beyond 
 thrice nine lands, in the thrice tenth kingdom, Vasilisa Kirbitievna
 sits in a tower, and her marrow flows from bone to bone." When the 
 prince had passed his fifteenth year, he began to ask the king's 
 leave to set out in search of his bride. "Whither will you go?"
 the father asked. "You are still too young." "No, father, when I 
 was little, my nurses and governesses sang lullabies to me and told 
 me where my bride lives; and now I wish to go and find her." The 
 father gave the prince his blessing and sent word to all the 
 kingdoms that his son, Prince Ivan, was setting out to find his 
 bride. 
 
 One day the prince came to a certain town, put up his horse to 
 be cared for, and went to walk in the streets. He came to 
 the square and saw that a man was being flogged with a whip. 
 "Why do you whip him?" he asked. "Because he borrowed ten 
 thousand rubles from a prominent merchant," they told him, 
 "and did not pay them back at the agreed time. As for the 
 man who redeems him, his wife will be carried off by Koshchey 
 the Deathless." The prince thought and thought and went away. 
 He walked through the town, then came to the square again, and 
 saw that the man was still being flogged; Prince Ivan took pity 
 on him and decided to redeem him. Since I have no wife, he 
 thought, no one can be taken from me. He paid the ten thousand 
 rubles and went home. Suddenly the man whom he had redeemed ran 
 after him, crying: "Thank you, Prince Ivan! If you had not 
 redeemed me, you would never have won your bride. But now I will 
 help you. Buy me a horse and a saddle at once." The prince bought
 him a horse and saddle and asked: "What is your name?" "My name is 
 Bulat the Brave," the man said. 
 They mounted their horses and set out. As soon as they 
 
 arrived in the thrice tenth kingdom, Bulat said: "Well, Prince Ivan, 
 order chickens, ducks, and geese to be bought and roasted, so that 
 there will be plenty of everything. And I will get your bride. But 
 mind you: every time I come to you, cut off the right wing of a 
 fowl and serve it to me on a plate." Bulat the Brave went straight 
 to the lofty tower where Vasilisa Kirbitievna was sitting, gently 
 threw a stone, and broke the gilded top of the tower. He ran to 
 Prince Ivan and said: "Why are you sleeping? Give me a chicken." 
 The prince cut off the right wing of a chicken and handed it to 
 him on a plate. Bulat took the plate, ran to the tower, and cried: 
 "Good day, Vasilisa Kirbitievna! Prince Ivan sends you his 
 greetings and has asked me to give you this chicken." The maiden 
 was frightened and sat in silence. But he answered himself in 
 her stead: "Good day, Bulat the Brave! Is Prince Ivan well? 
 Thank God, he is well. And why do you stand like that, Bulat the 
 Brave? Take the key, open the cupboard, drink a glass of vodka, 
 and God speed you. 
 
 Then Bulat ran to Prince Ivan. "Why are you sitting?" he said. 
 "Give me a duck." The prince cut off the right wing of a duck and 
 handed it to him on a plate. Bulat took the plate and carried it 
 to the tower. "Good day, Vasilisa Kirbitievna! Prince Ivan sends 
 you his greetings and has asked me to give you this duck." She
 sat in silence, and he answered himself in her stead: "Good day,
 Bulat the Brave! Is the prince well? Thank God, he is well. And 
 why do you stand like that, Bulat the Brave? Take the key, open
 the cupboard, drink a glass of vodka, and God speed you." Then 
 Bulat ran home and again said to Prince Ivan: "Why are you 
 sitting? Give me a goose." The prince cut off the right wing 
 of a goose and handed it to him on a plate. Bulat the Brave 
 took it to the tower. "Good day, Vasilisa Kirbitievna! Prince 
 Ivan sends his greetings and has asked me to give you this goose."
 Vasilisa Kirbitievna straightway took a key, opened a cupboard, and 
 gave him a glass of vodka. Bulat did not take the glass, but seized
 the maiden by her right hand, drew her out of the tower, and seated 
 her on Prince Ivan's horse, and the good youths gall
