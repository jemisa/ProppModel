Stravinsky and the Russian Traditions: A Biography of the Works Through Mavra
 By Richard Taruskin
 
 
 A soldier had requested leave, made ready, and set out a-marching. He marched and marched,
 but saw no water anywhere to soak himself a breadcrust and have a bite for the road, and his belly
 was long since empty. 
 
 There was nothign for it but to trudge further.
 
 He looked round an dspied a little brook a-running. 
 
 He went up to the broko, fetched three crusts from his knapsack, and set them in the water.
 
 And the soldier also had a fiddle.
 
 In his free time he would play various songs on it to stave off boredom.

 So the soldier sat down by the brook, took his fiddle, and started up a tune.
 
 Suddenly out of nowhere the Devil came up to him in the guise of an old man clutching a book.
 
 "Greetings, Mr. Serviceman!"
  - "Hello there, kind sir!"
  
  The devil winced a bit at being called a kind sir. 
  
  "Listen, old chap! Let's trade: I'll give you my book, and you give me the fiddle."
   - "Ha, old man! What do I want with your book? I've been in service to our sovereign for a good
   ten years now without being able to read.
   
   I never knew how, and now it's too late to learn!"
    - "Never mind, Serviceman! My book is such that whoever looks in it will know how to read it!"
     - "Well, let's have it. I'll give it a try!"
     
     
  The soldier opened the book and started to read as if he had known how since childhood. 
  
  He rejoiced and immediately exchanged his fiddle for it.
  
  The Devil took the fiddle, began working the bow, but it was no go.
  
  There was no sense to his playing. 
  
  "Listen, pal," he said to the soldier, "come be my guest for three days or so and teach me to play 
  the fiddle. I'll thank you for it!
  
   - No, old man," replied the soldier, "I am needed at home. In three days, time I'll be far from here."
   
    - "Please, serviceman, if you come stay with me and teach me to fiddle, I'll have you home in one day.
    I'll drive you in a post carriage."
    
    The soldier sat and pondered: should he go or not? And as he did so he fished a crust out of the brook,
     for he was hungry. 
     
"Hey serviceman, old pal," said the Devil, "your food is awful. Have some of mine!"

He untied his sack and brought out white bread, roast beef, vodka, and all kinds of goodies --.
 "Eat to your heart's content!"
 
 The soldier ate his fill, drank his fill, and agreed to stay with the old stranger and teach him to fiddle.
