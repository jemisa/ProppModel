Grandfather lived with a woman. 

And they had two sons and a daughter Broadsword. 

Beautiful grown sons - high so slender. And my daughter, she is still beautiful.

The sons of the land plowed, sowed grain, farm doing, it's lived.

Once they have coped with the work before the deadline, all fields were removed, had been brought and threshed.

Father looked on incomplete bins and even says:

- And some bread, my sons are cute, noneshnim summer sparingly freak. 

Do you not go to strangers on earnings? 

Stock woes does not repair.

Brothers thought - well, that's true: 

it would not hurt to have an extra penny on the farm. 

During the spring it will be possible to buy bread, since its not enough. 

Yes, that's where to go to work? Circle all the poor people live.

- Go for the forest - advises father. - Maybe you got there and who will hire.

Brothers scored grubs on sacks and say:

- If you do not come back in a week, let Palasha bring us fresh bread.

- And how do I know where you carry it? - Asks Broadsword.

- And we will take with him a sack of straw and will be on the road to throw on a straw - 

that's footprint and this will lead you to us.

- If so, then it is easy to me you will find - sister agreed.

Gathered brothers and went.

Yes go to the straw after a throw.

They passed a field included in the dense forest. 

And that lived in the forest with an iron Smoke terrible language. 

He saw that the brothers to look after themselves leave, took and threw straw on the other stitches. 

And that led straight stitch to The Bone Palace.

A week passed. Brothers did not return. Rejoices his father:

- It can be seen, they found a suitable job there. Take them, daughter, fresh bread.

Palasha took bread and more bread to something and moved on their way. Goes to all straws eyeing. 

Suddenly sees a palace - built from the bones of human, human skulls covered ...

Frightened girl, "Where I got it?" - He thinks.

And here and the master of the palace goes - scared rotten.

- Ah, - he grins - you got my hands! I long ago to look at you, pick up going to his palace. 

But you and she came to me. Well, now the father-mother forget me, Go. 

You will live in my palace Naymichka. And do not want to - abandoned and your skull to his roof.

Palasha burst into bitter tears, but what to do ... I do not have mercy filthy Smock.

Meanwhile Papashiny brothers really found a certain rich man good job. The order to work for their grub. 

Worked for a week and then see that grubs are already out. 

They waited, waited for her sister - and so it never came.

Brothers come home and ask:

- And why are you to us, dad, food is not sent?

- How not sent? - Surprised otets.- After Palasha you suffered and bread and bread ...

- No, - the brothers say - we see it and did not see.

Afraid of my father and mother, grieve: "Is not gone to see where my daughter?"

- I'll go look for her, - says the elder brother.

- Come, my son - my father and mother agreed. He was going to go. 

There is a dense forest, woods, sees - straws in the opposite direction was taken. 

So he went for the stitch where straws were, and came to The Bone Palace.

Palasha saw him from the window, ran to meet him.

- Oh, brother, my dear! - Unhappy crying sestra.- I now miserable slave ...

And she told her brother, in bondage to the trash Smokey hit.

- Do not cry, little sister - comforts her brother - I'll rescue.

- No, my friend, you do not know with whom you have business. Go'd better back soon, and then Smoke kill you. 

He is a hundred miles human spirit feels.

- I am not afraid of death - is responsible brother. 

- But let's better to think about how your master cheat you out of here as the father-mother to return.

Sister says:

- Wait a minute you're here, and I'll ask the owner, if he let you into his palace. 

And there we have something will come up.

She went to the Smoky Mountains.

- What would you - he says - the owner, do if my brother came here to see me?

- As a guest would be accepted - Smoke grinned. Palasha believed him and his brother led to the palace.

Smoke guest seated at the table and says Broadsword:

- Bring us iron beans. Brought Palasha iron pot of beans.

- Come on, gostyushka, popoludnuem - says Smock. And he began to rake in handfuls from the boiler.

And took one guest bobok, held in the mouth and the spat.

Smoke grimaced.

- You see, the guest does not hurt hungry? ..

- And thank you, - says a guest - there I really do not want to ...

- Well, let's go see my wealth. Bypassed they rest, all in good cellars -r- 

Smoke and not to consider: gold and silver, and precious furs.

Smoke guest led to the stables. And there stood twelve stallions, 

stallion and every twelve chains chained to iron stakes.

- Well, the guest of us richer: you or me? - Praise the host.

- But where have I be with you - said the guest. - I have a hundredth part of no.

- Now I'll show you one more thing. Smoke brought him to the deck - in four fathoms thick, twelve long.

- You see this deck?

- I see - meets guest.

- So if you are without an ax to sever it will burn without fire, then come back home alive. 

And is not the death of you!

Guest says:

- Though kill me on the spot and do this, I can not.

- You can not! - Smoke shouted. - What are you to visit me was? 

You're with me, with himself king of the forest, make friends thought of!

Smoke killed a guest, eyes gouged out, and most in the stables hung on the bar.

A day passed, then another, never came home elder brother.

Says while the younger brother of the father-mother:

- I'll go look for her sister.

Sorry for the father-mother to let him into the unknown road, he's the last they stayed. 

Then they began to dissuade him.

- No, - said the younger brother - go, gathered and went.

Well, of course, and it happened the same as with the senior.

Visit of Palasha loud wail;

- Oh, master! Why my siblings got used to the light? 

Some of the older men, my father and mother, I have stayed. 

If so, then kill me and hang in his stable at the same time with the brothers ...

- No, - grins Smoke - kill you I will not. 

But if the father and mother to catch, so just kill you to be more about them and did not think.

It became difficult to live without a father-mother-children. 

They sit, grieve: who in his old age look after them, who will bury ...

Once the woman went to fetch water. Lo and behold - rolling on the road pea. 

She lifted the pea and ate.

And soon the boy was born to them. Yes, such a comely - full, curly, brown hair with. 

And they gave him the name of my father and mother Pokatigoroshek.

Boy growing by leaps and bounds. Rejoice father and mother, admire - will help them in their old age. 

Only one problem: touch a someone from the children, playing, Pokatigoroshek and child and falls like a sheaf. 

Every day come to the old man and an old woman's neighbors complain that 

Pokatigoroshek supposedly offends their children.

So here he grew up.

One became Pokatigoroshek asking his mother:

- Why do I have one? Why I do not have any sisters or brothers?

Mother wiped her eyes and a scarf angle says:

- Were you, son, and brothers and sister ...

- Where are they? Kohl were dead, I can not do anything in the forces, 

and a stake in captivity were, then go their disembarrass.

She told her mother that she knew about their children.

The next day came Pokatigoroshek out for a walk. Found there some old carnations, brought it home and says:

- Take, Tata, the carnations to the blacksmith and tell him to forge his mace twelve pounds.

Father did not say anything to him, and thought to himself:

"That little child something which I have the people, not the same as in humans. 

Is still small, and already a father laughs. 

Where are you seen that of cloves dvenadtsatipudovuyu mace forge? "

Father threw carnations on the shelf, and he went to the blacksmith and ordered him 25 maces.
In the evening brings the mace home. 

Took Pokatigoroshek mace, went to the garden, swung and threw it into the sky. 

And he went back into the house and went to bed.

The next morning Pokatigoroshek rose, fell right ear to the ground, hears buzzing earth!

- Tata! - Klichet son. - Go-ka listen, mace something back from the sky flying.

Framed he knee, mace hit the knee and broke in two. Pokatigoroshek looked at her and said:

- I like you, Tata, did not mace from the iron that I gave you. Tell the blacksmith to make from the stud!

Father scratched his head and went back to the blacksmith, this time with a nail.

Surprised smith - how it can be of cloves yes dvenadtsatipudovuyu mace forged! But still went to work. 

Threw carnations into the fire, and he and allowed to grow by leaps and bounds. Grows and grows.

Forged blacksmith from cloves dvenadtsatipudovuyu mace, but still there is so much iron is left ...

Father brought home a mace. Son looked at her and asked:

- What blacksmith forged mace? Maybe, again, not of roses?

- No, now, - says the father - everything has been done as you asked.

Raised Pokatigoroshek mace on his shoulder, said goodbye to his mother and father 
went through the world search for her sister and brothers.

Long or short was he still came to Smokovu palace. In the courtyard met his sister Broadsword.

- Who are you? - Asks. - And why come here? After all, there terrible prestrashny Smoke-lived ...

Pokatigoroshek told her who he was and where he was going.

- No, - said Broadsword - it's not true: I had two brothers, 
but killed a foul Smoke them on the bar in the stables hung.
And you're not my brother.

And do not believe it.

- Suffer So even spend the night with you! - Asked Pokatigoroshek. Palasha went to Smokey.

- Why are you so zapechalilas? - Asks her Smock.

- Yes, that's lad came some and says that he's my brother. Asks to spend the night on the road.

Smoke took his magic book, opened it, looked and said:

- Yes, you will still be one brother ... But this ... This is cheating. Call it a minute here, I'll talk to him.

Pokatigoroshek went to Smokey 1

- Good afternoon, boss!

- Hello, Guest!

Smoke put on the table a treat - iron beans.

- Sit down, - he showed Pokatigoroshku on iron chair.

Only Pokatigoroshek villages, so the chair and collapsed.

- Uh, the owner - surprised Pokatigoroshek. - And fragile as you seat! Is there no good masters, 
that have made stronger?

Smoke scared. Brought another chair, stronger.

Pokatigoroshek sat at the table. Smoke pot slipped him.

- Help yourself.

- Yes, I'm really hungry for a long way, - says Pokatigoroshek.

And they have. Smoke vsyplet handful in your Rtishchev and Pokatigoroshek - two. 

Eat as much behind the ears bursting.

Empty the entire pot.

- Well, ate? - Asks Smock.

- Not really. Only a worm Zamora. Sees Smoke: food he can not cope with these boys!

- So let's go look at my wealth - Smock says.

Smoke Pokatigoroshku showed all his wealth.

- Who has more good - grins Smoke - Your place or mine?

- I'm not rich, - says Pokatigoroshek - but you have nothing to brag about something. Smoke angry.

- Are you kidding me! Come, I'll show you one thing.

Pokatigoroshka he brought to the same deck to which his brothers and drove.

- If no ax to sever it will burn without fire, then let you go home. And no - you will be there, 

where your brothers ...

- Well, we'll see! - Laughing Pokatigoroshek.- not scare crow falcon!

He touched his finger to the little finger-deck, and that once and crumbled into small chips.

And then as breathed, so from chips and nothing is left.

Sees Smoke - not just guests caught.

- Come on now wrestle - says Smock. - Let's see which of us is stronger.

- Why just fight. Let's first try at hand: I clench your hand, and you are mine.

- But where really you, sucker, with me in her arms to compete! - Has become a hot Smock.

- Nothing, come on!

Smoke angry in earnest g

- Come on!

Grab. Pokatigoroshkova hand just turned blue and Smokova already blackened.

- No, - says Smock - so fight I do not agree. Let's different.

He breathed - Make a copper current. Breathed Pokatigoroshek - became silver.

Began to fight. Breathed Smoke - drove Pokatigoroshka in silver current on the ankle. 

Pounded mace Pokatigoroshek culled Smoke - Smoke went into a copper current on his knees. 

The second time breathed Smoke - drove Pokatigoroshka in silver on the current lap.

A Pokatigoroshek as mace slammed culled Smoke - Smoke went in for the most current copper chest. 

Smoke query:

- Wait a minute Guest: let's take rest.

- Yes, we do not hurt and tired - I grins Pokatigoroshek.- long road and it feels nothing. 

And you all day is stored for itself as a pan.

Smoke thought, shook his head and said:

- It is clear mind boy, you're going to kill me.

- To come and me!

- Leave me at least half a lifetime - Smoke yelled. 

- Take all my wealth, just before his death, Thou shalt not kill.

- No, the evil spirit that's enough! You .obozval me Whipper, profaned, and now you are welcome. 

Nope you mercy!

Pokatigoroshek escaped from a silver current and let's beat mace culled Smoke.

Beat, beat and drove it into a copper current on the ears.

Here Smokey and the end came.

Pokatigoroshek rested a little and went to Smokovu stable.

Brought one horse in the field, took off his skin bag and climbed into the bag itself.

Sits there and waits. Raven crow flies from. Steel skin peck. A crow Pokatigoroshek grabbed his leg.

I saw this old crow, spoke in a human voice:

- Who's there?

- I Pokatigoroshek.

- Give me my child.

- Obtain tselyaschey and living water - give.

- Well, - has agreed to crows. - Obtain.

He took two flasks and flew to distant lands, tridesyatom kingdom.

And in that realm beat out of a mountain spring water with tselyaschey, and from the other

- with the living water. Scored crows water and one or the other and back gate.

- On - says Pokatigoroshku - you water, only give me a child.

Then suddenly Pokatigoroshek crow ripped in two.

- Ay-yay! - Wail old crows. - What have you done?

- Nothing, - says Pokatigoroshek. - This is me to try.

He sprinkled the crow tselyaschey water - to make it whole, sprinkled living - alive crow.

- Well, you see - happy Pokatigoroshek - now I know what it is water.

He thanked the old crow, and went to the stables, the dead brothers. 

Sprinkled them living water - alive brothers, sprinkled tselyaschey - eyes received sight.

- Oh, - say the brothers - and as long as we slept! ..

- Sleep like you here forever, if I'm not - responsible Pokatigoroshek.

Brothers rubbed their eyes, peering.

- Who are you? - Ask Pokatigoroshka.

- Your brother.

- No, - arguing younger brother - the brothers we have no more. Are you kidding. 

And the elder brother says:

- Well: whoever you are, and if we rescued out of trouble, you give us and brother.

Brothers hugged Pokatigoroshka, thanked him. Then burned Smokey Bone Palace,
took my sister and together returned home.

And there went a feast for the whole world. And I have been. Honey, wine drinking.

Beard flowed, and the mouth is not horrible. And the whole tale.
