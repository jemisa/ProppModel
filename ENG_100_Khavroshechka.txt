You know that there are people in the world and good, there are worse, there are those who do not fear God, 
my brother is not ashamed: among these could be included KroshechkaKhavroshechka. She was left as a small orphan; 
these people  took her, fed her, and into the godly world they did not let her go for she had to toil every day
and delivery and clean up and to be responsible for everything.

The lady had three daughters. The eldest was called OneEye, the middle one was called TwoEye, and the little 
one was called ThreeEye. They knew the gates and could look on the street, but Kroshechka-Havroshechka had 
to work for them, sow for them, spin and weave for them. For all this, a good word was never heard. That just
hurts.

One day it happened that KroshechkaKhavroshechka was in a field and she embraced a poor cow about the neck
and told the cow her woes. 

"O CowMother! I was beaten, berated, starved, and told not to cry. For tomorrow, I have to spin, weave, and
blanch."

The cow answered to her:

"Fair maiden! Crawl into my ear and then crawl out the other. Then everything will work out."

So it happened that after KroshechkaKhavroshechka crawled into one ear and out of the other ear that 
that everything was ready before the fair maiden's eyes. The linen was spun and whitewashed. 
She will take it off to the step-mother. She will look at it, groan, hide in the trunk and then assign
more work. KroshechkaKhavroshechka again goes to the cow, crawls into one ear, crawls out the other 
ear, and brings back finished linen.

The StepMother calls OneEye: "Come, my good and comely daughter. Please observe who it is that helps 
orphan to weave and spin and roll the spindle?" 
"Go to sleep, eye." KroshechkaHavroshechka says. 
OneEye fell asleep on the grass under the sun. 
While OneEye was sleeping, KroshechkaHavroshechka crawled in one of the cow's ears and out of the out
with finished linen. 
The Stepmother asks OneEye: "Who is it that helps KroshechkaHavroshechka?"
"I went to the woods with KroshechkaHavroshechka in the field, but I fell asleep and forget the orders."

The StepMother next sent TwoEye, but she too fell asleep.
Havroshechka lulled her: "Sleep, eye, sleep, another one!"
And the cow weaved, whitewashed, and spun the spindles while TwoEye was still asleep.

The Step-mother became angry and on the third day she sent ThreeEye and gave KroshechkaKhavroshechka more work. 
ThreeEye and her sisters jumped up and down and fell on the grass. KroshechkaKhavroshechka sings: "Sleep, eye, 
sleep, another one!" But she forgot about the third eye. Two eyes fell asleep, but the third eye looks and sees
everything.

ThreeEye saw KroshechkaKhavroshechka crawl into one ear and out of the other with all of the fresh linen. 
ThreeEye told her mother about what she saw. StepMother was happy and went the next day to her husband. 
She told him to slaughter the cow. The old man said to her, "So wise wife, what do you have it mind? Will we buy 
a young cow then?" The old man sharpened his knife. 

KroshechkaKhavroshechka ran to the cow, "CowMother! They want to slaughter you." 

"But you, fair maiden, do not eat my meat. Gather my bones into a handkerchief and plant them in a garden
and never forget to water them every morning.

KroshechkaKhavroshechka did everything that the CowMother bequeathed: she did not eat of the CowMother's meat
and she watered the bones every day in the garden. An apple tree grew out of the bones. Apples hung from the 
branches and it had gold and silver leaves. Everyone admired the tree.

Once it happened that that all the girls were walking in the garden; they passed a young lord with curly hair.
He noticed the apples and began: "Beautiful maidens! Whichever one of you hits the bullseye, she will marry me."
The sisters wanted to hit them. Some of the apples hung low and other high. Nothing they seemed to do worked.

Then came KroshechkaKhavroshechka and the twigs bent and the apples fell. The lord married her and they lived 
happily ever after.
