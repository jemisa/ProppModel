 In some kingdom, in some state there lived-was the tsar; at this tsar was three daughters and one son, Ivan-tsarevitch. The tsar has grown old and has died, and the crown was accepted by Ivan-tsarevitch.
      As the next kings have learnt about that, have now collected incalculable armies and have gone on it войною. Ivan-tsarevitch does not know, how to it to be; comes to sisters and asks:
      - Kind my sisters! What to me to do? All kings have risen on me войною.
      - Ah you, the brave soldier! Of that was frightened? How White Полянин is at war with the woman-jagoju - gold ногою, thirty years from a horse does not climb down, роздыху does not know? And you, nothing seeing, were frightened!
      Ivan-tsarevitch has immediately saddled the kind horse, has put on a harness military, took a sword-kladenets, a spear долгомерное and плетку silk and has left against the enemy. The falcon is not clear flies on herd of geese, swans and on grey утиц - Ivan-tsarevitch attacks an army вражее; not so much sword beats, how many a horse tramples down; has interrupted all troops вражее, it was turned back in a city, has laid down to sleep and slept three days a deep dream. - for the fourth days has woken up, left on a balcony, has looked in an open country - kings more than that armies have collected and again under the walls have risen.
      Запечалился a tsarevitch, goes to sisters:
      - Ah, sisters! What to me to do? One force has exterminated, another under a city costs, more threatens.
      - What you the soldier! Days was at war yes three days without просыпа slept. How White Полянин is at war with the woman-jagoju - gold ногою, thirty years from a horse does not climb down, роздыху does not know?
      Ivan-tsarevitch has run in белокаменные stables, has saddled a kind horse powerful, has put on a harness military, has surrounded a sword-kladenets, in one hand took a spear долгомерное, in another - плетку silk and has left against the enemy.
      The falcon is not clear flies on herd of geese, swans and on grey утиц - Ivan-tsarevitch attacks an army вражее; not so much itself beats, how many the horse tramples down it. Has beaten a host-force great, it was turned back home, has laid down to sleep and was fast asleep six days.
      For the seventh days has woken up, left on a balcony, has looked in an open country kings more than that armies have collected and again all city have surrounded.
      There is Ivan-tsarevitch to sisters:
      - Kind my sisters! What to me to do? Two forces has exterminated, the third under walls costs, still more threatens.
      - Ah you, the brave soldier! One days was at war yes six without просыпа slept. How White Полянин is at war with the woman-jagoju - gold ногою, thirty years from a horse does not climb down, роздыху does not know?
      Bitterly that seemed to a tsarevitch; he has run in белокаменные stables, has saddled the kind horse powerful, has put on a harness military, has surrounded a sword-kladenets, in one hand took a spear долгомерное, in another - плетку silk and has left against the enemy.
      The falcon is not clear flies on herd of geese, swans and on grey утиц - Ivan-tsarevitch attacks an army вражее; not so much itself beats, how many the horse tramples down it. Has beaten a host-force great, it was turned back home, has laid down to sleep and was fast asleep nine days.
      For the tenth days has woken up, has called all ministers and senators:
      - Misters my ministers and senators! I have taken in head to go to another's countries, on White Полянина to look; I ask you to judge and рядить, all affairs to assort under the truth.
      Then has said goodbye to sisters, villages on a horse and has gone to a way-road.
      Whether long, whether shortly - it has called in in dark wood; sees - the izba costs, and in that izba the person is old lives. Ivan-tsarevitch has come to it:
      - Hi, the grandfather!
      - Hi, Russian tsarevitch! Where you go?
      - I search White Полянина, whether you know, where it?
      - Itself I do not know, and here wait, I will collect the true servants and I will ask them.
      The old man has acted on крылечко, has played in a silver pipe - and have suddenly begun to it from different directions birds to be flied. Has flown them multitudes, black тучею all sky have covered.
      Has shouted the person a loud voice is old, has whistled a valiant whistling:
      - Servants my true, birds flying! Did not see ль, have not heard ль that about White Полянина?
      - No, a kind did not see, слыхом have not heard!
      - Well, Ivan-tsarevitch, - speaks the person is old, - go now to my big brother - can, he to you will tell. On, take клубочек, start up before itself: where клубочек will sweep, there and a horse direct. Ivan-tsarevitch has sat down on the kind horse, has driven клубочек and has gone after it, and wood all more darkly yes is more dark.
      There comes a tsarevitch to an izba, enters into doors; in an izba the old man sits white as snow.
      - Hi, the grandfather!
      - Hi, Russian tsarevitch! Where a way you hold?
      - I search White Полянина, whether you know, where it?
      - And here погоди, I will collect the true servants and I will ask them.
      The old man has acted on крылечко, has played in a silver pipe - and different animals have suddenly gathered to it from different directions. Has shouted it a loud voice, has whistled a valiant whistling:
      - Servants my true, animals порыскучие! Did not see ль, have not heard ль that about White Полянина?
      - No, - animals answer, - a kind did not see, слыхом have not heard.
      - And well, pay off промеж itself: can, not all have come.
      Animals have paid off - there is no curve she-wolf. The old man has sent to search for it; messengers have immediately run and have resulted it.
      - Affect, a curve she-wolf, whether you know White Полянина?
      - As to me it not to know, if I at it завсегда I live: it beats armies, and I eat a dead corpse.
      - Where it now?
      - In an open country on the big barrow, in a tent sleeps. He was at war with baboju-jagoju-jagoju - gold ногою, and after fight has lain down for twelve days to sleep.
      - Spend there Ivan-tsarevitch. The she-wolf has run, and after it a tsarevitch has jumped.
      It comes to the big barrow, enters into a tent - White Полянин sound sleep rests.
      "Here my sisters said, that White Полянин without роздыху is at war, and he for twelve days to sleep has lain down! Whether to fall asleep and me while?" Has thought-has thought Иванцаревич and has laid down with it nearby.
      Here the small birdie has arrived in a tent, is twisted at the headboard and speaks those words:
      - Rise-clear up, White Полянин, and betray Ivan-tsarevitch malicious death: not that will rise - you will kill!
      Ivan-tsarevitch has jumped, has expelled a birdie from a tent and has again laid down near White Полянина. Has not had time to fall asleep, as other birdie arrives, is twisted at a headboard and speaks:
      - Rise-clear up, White Полянин, and betray Ivan-tsarevitch malicious death: not that will rise - you will kill!
      Ivan-tsarevitch has jumped, has expelled a birdie from a tent and has again laid down on the same place. After that the third birdie arrives, is twisted at a headboard and speaks:
      - Rise-clear up, White Полянин, and betray Ivan-tsarevitch malicious death: not that will rise - you will kill!
      Ivan-tsarevitch has jumped, has turned out a birdie from a tent, and itself has laid down and has strong fallen asleep.
      Has come it is time - has cleared up White Полянин, looks - near to it незнамо what athlete lays; has seized for a sharp sword and wanted was to betray its malicious death, yes it was kept in time. "Is not present, - thinks, - it has driven into me on sleepy, and a sword did not want кровавить; not honour, not praise and me, the kind good fellow to ruin it! Sleepy that the dead! I will better wake him". Has woken Ivan-tsarevitch and asks:
      - Whether kind, whether the thin person? Speak, how you by name call and what for here has called in?
      - Call me Ivan-tsarevitch, and has arrived on you to look, your force to try.
      - Painfully courageously you, a tsarevitch! Without demand into a tent has entered, has slept, it is possible you for that for death to betray!
      - Эх, White Полянин! Has not jumped through a ditch, yes you brag; wait can, спотыкнешься! At you two hands, and mother not with one has given birth to me. They have sat down on the powerful horses, have gathered and have hit, yes so is strong, that their spears have into smithereens scattered, and kind horses on knees got. Ivan-tsarevitch вышиб from a saddle White Полянина also has brought over it a sharp sword. Has begged to it White Полянин:
      - Do not give death, give me a stomach [41]! I will be called as your smaller brother, instead of the father I will esteem. Ivan-tsarevitch took it for a hand, has lifted from the earth, has kissed on lips and named the smaller brother.
      - I heard, the brother, that you with бабойягою - золотою ногою are at war thirty years. For what at you war?
      - There is at it a polonjanka-beauty, wish to extract yes to marry.
      - Well, - a tsarevitch has told, - if friendship to drive, so with a trouble to help! We will go to be at war together.
      Have sat down on horses, have left in an open country; the baba-yaga - a gold foot has exposed a host-force infinite. Not clear falcons fly that on herd pigeon - athletes on an army вражее are filled сильномогучие! Not with so much swords cut, how many horses trample down; прирубили, притоптали the whole thousand.
      The Baba-yaga наутек has rushed, and Ivan-tsarevitch behind it after. Absolutely was to make up became - as it has suddenly come running to a deep precipice, has lifted a pig-iron board and has disappeared under землею.
      Ivan-tsarevitch and White Полянин have bought bulls many set, have started them to beat, skin to remove yes belts to cut; from those belts a rope have twisted - yes such long, that one end here, and on a next world will get another.
      Tsarevitch White Полянину speaks:
      - Lower me more soon in a precipice, yes back rope do not pull out, and wait: as I will pull a rope, then drag!
      White Полянин has lowered it in a precipice on the bottom. Ivan-tsarevitch has looked around and has gone to search for a baba-yaga.
      Went, went, looks - tailors sit at a lattice.
      - What do you do?
      - And here that, Ivan-tsarevitch: we sit yes an army we sew for a baba-yaga - a gold foot.
      - How you sew?
      - It is known as: that you will prick иглою also the Cossack with пикою, on a horse sits down, in a system becomes and goes war on White Полянина.
      - Эх, brothers! Soon you do, yes is not strong; become abreast, I will learn you how more strong to sew. They were immediately built in one number, and Ivan-tsarevitch both will wave a sword, and heads have departed. Has beaten tailors and has gone further.
      Went, went, looks - for решеткою shoemakers sit.
      - What you here do?
      - We sit an army we prepare for a baba-yaga - a gold foot.
      - How you, brothers, prepare an army?
      - And here is how: that шилом we will prick, also the soldier with a gun, on a horse sits down, in a system becomes and goes war on White Полянина.
      - Эх, children! Soon you do, yes not споро. Become abreast, I will better learn you.
      Here they became abreast. Ivan-tsarevitch has waved a sword, and heads have departed. Has beaten shoemakers - and again in road.

      - Ah, Ivan-tsarevitch, after all me searches for it White Полянин, and the baba-yaga is fast asleep now, has lain down for twelve days.

      - Beat still, Ivan-tsarevitch!
      - Powerful blow and one is good! - a tsarevitch answered, was turned back in towers to the bashful person, villages with it for tables oak, for cloths браные. Naelsja-has got drunk and began it to ask:
      - Whether is in light краше you?
      - Ah, Ivan-tsarevitch! That I for the beauty! Here is how at the other end of the world, in тридесятом a kingdom there lives at the tsar-dragon the princess, so that originally beauty inexpressible.
      Ivan-tsarevitch took the bashful person for a white hand, has led to that place where the rope hung, and has given a sign White Полянину. That has grasped a rope and allow to pull; pulled, pulled and has pulled out a tsarevitch with the bashful person.
      - Hi, White Полянин, - Ivan-tsarevitch, - here to you the bride has told, live, have fun, about what be not destroyed! And I will go to a snake kingdom.
      Villages on the powerful horse, has said goodbye with White Полянином and it невестою and has jumped at the other end of the world.
